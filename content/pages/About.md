Hi!

My name's Ansel Horn.

I live in vibrant Vermont between the heights of the Green Mountains and the
expanse of Lake Champlain.

I like computers, math, logic, biology, chemistry, artificial intelligence,
philosophy, history, cooking, music performance & composition, Brazilian
jiu-jitsu, judo, capoeira, swing & ballroom dance, hiking, skiing, biking, and
windsurfing.

I'm searching for elegant engineering, beautiful landscapes, great storytelling,
and experiences of the sublime.
