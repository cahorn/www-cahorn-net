A couple of years back, I made a proof-of-concept, search-based AI to solve
ThinkFun's [Gordian's Knot](https://a.co/d/3BjjgQH), a disassembly puzzle that I
particularly like. It included rudimentary support for OpenGL rendering and
state-space visualization with [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/). While an
interesting novelty, I never put in the time to polish it for release.

But it gave me an idea: what if we could explore not only the state-space of
*this particular puzzle*, but the state-space of *all* rectilinear disassembly
puzzles?

Hmm... ðŸ¤”
